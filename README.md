# BlazeGuard: Our Fire Prediction Machine Learning Model 

## Overview
Put a brief description of what the project does, its purpose, and the problem it solves.

## Features
- Developed a machine learning model to predict fire spread based on satellite imagery using Python and TensorFlow, finetuning a UNet to fit our needs.
- Built a user-friendly frontend website with React, allowing users to upload satellite images for fire spread prediction.
- Designed and implemented a backend server to process images, run the predictive model, and return results to the frontend for visualization.
- Integrated frontend and backend components to provide seamless image processing and prediction results, enhancing user experience.
- Ensured high performance and accuracy of the predictive model through continuous testing and validation with real-world satellite imagery data.
- Utilized RESTful API design for efficient communication between the frontend and backend services.
- Incorporated image preprocessing techniques to improve the quality and reliability of model predictions.
- Maintained version control and collaborative development through Git and GitHub, ensuring smooth project workflow and codebase management.
